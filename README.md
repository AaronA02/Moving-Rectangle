# Dynamic Rectangle Animation

## Overview

This project exemplifies the application of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create a sophisticated, interactive rectangle animation that dynamically follows the user's mouse movements across the viewport. Utilizing advanced JavaScript and CSS techniques, the rectangle's position is smoothly interpolated, offering a visually compelling and fluid user experience.

## Features

- **Seamless Animation**: Employing GSAP's robust animation capabilities, the rectangle's movement is characterized by a smooth transition that enhances user engagement.
- **Responsive Interaction**: The rectangle's position is dynamically recalculated based on the user's mouse movements, ensuring a responsive and intuitive interaction.
- **Adaptive Boundaries**: The script intelligently maps the mouse's x-coordinate to the rectangle's position, keeping it within predefined horizontal constraints.
